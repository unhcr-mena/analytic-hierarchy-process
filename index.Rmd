## Scoring Vulnerability 

Vulnerability is not observed 
- Intellectual construction based on multiple - criteria 

The challenge is:
- Define the criteria 
- Define relative weight to be used for each criteria 

## Define weights through expert judgment 
- How each expert can come up with values for the weight? 
- How to reach agreement among expert on the suggested values? 
- Is there an alternative to expert consensus building? 

## The analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
- Structured technique for organizing and analysing complex decisions, based on mathematics and psychology 
- Comprehensive and rational framework to organise feeling, intuition & logic for structuring group decision making 
- Comparison is made between 2 alternatives based on decision-maker’s feeling of priority dues to importance, preference and likelihood of influence 
- Developed in the 70’s by Thomas Saaty

## How to?

1. Define vulnerability criteria
2. Establish priorities between criteria by making a series of 
3. judgments based on pairwise comparisons.
4. Synthesize these judgments to yield a set of overall priorities
5. Check judgments consistency
6. Compute weights

## Define vulnerability criteria

List all potential criteria that would contribute to vulnerability within the current context – for instance

    Age of head of household is above 50
    Gender of head of household is female
    Household size is above 5
    Occurrence of Specific needs
    Do not Receive assistance

## Hierarchy Tree


## Ranking Scales for Criteria
- Collect judgment for all pairwise comparison and each expert
- Compute weights for each expert
- Mathematical calculations to convert these judgments to priorities for each of the four criteria

## Check consistencies
- Calculate consistency ratio
- Lack of consistency is always observed
If consistency ratio is above 0.1, then judgement are untrustworthy because they are too close to randomness -> exercise needs to be repeated or abandonned
- Calculate mean relative weight
- Apply the vulnerability formula
- Collect data on each criteria for all household
- Apply weight to each record for the different criteria to get the vulnerability level of each household


## Limitation of AHP
Assume a minimum level of judgement consistency
Limited number of criteria (not more than 7…)
Data should be available for all criteria
Assume that when new alternatives are added to a decision problem, the ranking of the old alternatives must not change 

## Implementation
 - Calculation can be done using R statistical language
